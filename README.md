# Power of EURUSD

Power of EURUSD is a forex software developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. This code provides an example of how the software works and can be used for market analysis and trading.

## Global Variables

- `g_EMA1`: Holds the value of the 10-period exponential moving average (EMA) of the EURUSD currency pair.
- `g_EMA2`: Holds the value of the 20-period exponential moving average (EMA) of the EURUSD currency pair.

## Initialization

In the `OnInit()` function, the initial values for the global variables `g_EMA1` and `g_EMA2` are set by using the `iMA` function to calculate the EMA values.

## Market Analysis

The `MarketAnalysis()` function calculates the current values of the EMAs using the `iMA` function. It then compares the values of `currentEMA1` and `currentEMA2` to determine the market condition.

- If `currentEMA1` is greater than `currentEMA2`, a buy signal is generated.
- If `currentEMA1` is less than `currentEMA2`, a sell signal is generated.

You can place your own code for executing buy or sell trades in the respective sections.

## Trading Functions

The `BuySignal()` and `SellSignal()` functions are placeholders for your own code to execute buy and sell trades, respectively. You can add your own logic and trading strategies here.

## Main Program

The `OnTick()` function is the main entry point of the program. It calls the `MarketAnalysis()` function to perform market analysis on each tick.

## Program Termination

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the program is terminated. You can place your own code for program termination here.
